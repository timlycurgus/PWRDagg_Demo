# PWRDagg_Demo
This repository contains example code constructing PWRD aggregation weights from a synthetic data set that mirrors the structure of a supplemental instruction reading intervention.

It contains the following:

  - PWRD_Demo.Rmd: an RMarkdown file that demonstrates construction of PWRD aggregation weights from synthetic data.
  - PWRD_Demo.pdf: the compiled RMarkdown file. 
  - PWRD_Demo.csv: the synthetic data used in PWRD_Demo.Rmd. This data mirrors the structure of a reading intervention providing supplemental instruction to students falling behind in learning to read.
